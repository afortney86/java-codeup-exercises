 Create a third player class that extends Player and implements the generateRoshambo method.
 For this class, generateRoshambo gets input from the human player and returns the value chosen.
 Use a Validator class to validate the user’s entries.

 Bonus

 Keep track of wins and losses, and display them at the end of each session.

//Prompt the player to enter a name and select an opponent.
//Prompt the player to select rock, paper, or scissors. Then display the player’s choice, the opponent’s choice, and the result of the match.
//Continue until the user doesn’t want to play anymore.
//If the user makes an invalid selection, display an appropriate error message and prompt the user again until the user makes a valid selection.
//Create a class called RoshamboApp that allows the user to play against either of your first two player classes.
