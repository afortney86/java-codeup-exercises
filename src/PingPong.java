//Game Development 102
//
//        In this exercise you are going to build a ping pong game!
//
//        In case you are only familiar with the college version of ping pong, here is a brief explanation:
//
//        You will need two players. First player will be user controlled, second player will be the CPU.
//        The objective of this game is to make sure the CPU does not hit the ball, for which you will gain a point.
//        Ask the player which side of the table they would like to swing their paddle (left or right).
//        Have a random generator of a ping pong ball that will determine what side of the table the ball is going to.
//        If you swing the paddle at the same side the ball is going then it's the CPU's turn to swing. If you miss, the CPU gets a point
//        Same dynamic applies for the CPU, except you will need to write a function that will determine what side the CPU will be swinging at.
//        First player to 7 points wins!
